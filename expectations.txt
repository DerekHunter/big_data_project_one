Big Data Project 1
Team Expectations

1. We will show up to meetings on time. If a conflict arises, we will inform another member of the team as soon as possible.

2. If we are having a difficult time completing our agreed upon task(s) before the next team meeting, we will discuss our difficulty with another team member and try to resolve it before the meeting.

3. We will communicate often with each other and reallocate responsibilities if any one of us feels like we are doing too much or too little.

4. With our combined computer science and statistical skills we will take over the world!!! Mwah-ha-hah!
